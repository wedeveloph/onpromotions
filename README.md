# On Promotions and Partnerships
Developh does not partake in partnership exchanges where we're asked promotions of (likes/shares/engaegments to a page or post).

1. Our structure as an organization doesn't allow us to take these on. Internally, we're a small core team. If you're reaching us because of our network, e can't obligate our community members to share posts.
2. Promotional exchanges based on static numbers advantage quantity over quality.
3. There's little depth to it.

For donation calls, we partner with organizations through NoStudentLeft.com; contact education@developh.org.


If you're interested in partnering with us in a more genuine manner (exchanging knowledge, community, materials), feel free to reach back out to us!
In the past, Developh has offered partners support on our newsletter reaching thousands of readers, connected partners with figures in the student startup ecosystem and tech industry, co-created workshops and fundraisers, hosted hackathons, and the like. If you're looking for something meaningful with us, we'd encourage you to schedule a short 10-minute call with us so we know how we can help each other.
